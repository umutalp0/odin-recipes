  <p>These savory-sweet shrimp skewers are easy to make and cook in just a few minutes. They are perfect for summer weeknights or weekend dinner parties. Prep the sauce ahead of time for an even faster dinner. I prefer to use jumbo shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), however use what you have on hand.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/3 cup water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
      <li>1 pound jumbo shrimp</li>
      <li>1/2 fresh pineapple, cored and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  <p>Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 8 to 10 minutes.
</p>
  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately onto skewers and place on a platter.</p>
  <h3>Step 3</h3>
  <p>Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until shrimp is opaque and cooked through. Turn grill to low heat and brush sauce on both sides of skewers. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with cilantro and sesame seeds.</p>
